police_shooting <- read_csv("~/Documents/Github/fatal-police-shootings-data (2).csv")

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}

#Have to filter by date, check the one extra death
police_shooting_men<- police_shooting %>% 
  select(gender, armed, date, race) %>% 
  filter(gender=="M", date < '2020-09-04')
police_shooting_women <- police_shooting %>% 
  select(gender, armed, name, date, race) %>% 
  filter(gender=="F",date <'2020-09-04')

#Get the count of unarmed, and then the count of everything else and the assumptions that were made
#!'Unarmed'
```

**1) Since The Washington Post began [tracking fatal shootings by police](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/) in 2015, officers have fatally shot 247 women out of the more than 5,600 people killed overall. Of the 247 women fatally shot, 48 were Black and seven of those were unarmed.**

```{r}
#finding the total rows of the data to see how many were shot 
nrow(police_shooting_date)
#there are 5609 rows, meaning 5609 people were fatally shot by police between 2015 to 2020

#finding the number of females in the data 
sum(police_shooting_date$gender == "F", na.rm = TRUE)
#there are 248 rows, meaning that 248 females were fatally shot by police

#finding the number of women who identified as black in the women dataset
police_shooting_women %>%
  select(name, armed, date, race) %>%
  filter (race == "B") %>%
  nrow()
#there are 48 rows, meaning that of the 248 females, 48 identified as black

#finding the number of women who were unarmed in the women dataset
police_shooting_women %>%
  select(name, armed, date, race) %>%
  filter (race == "B", armed == "unarmed") %>%
  nrow()
#there are 7 rows, meaning of the black women fatally shot, 7 were unarmed 

```

**2) Since 2015, Black women have accounted for less than 1 percent of the overall fatal shootings in cases where race was known. But within this small subset, Black women, who are 13 percent of the female population, account for 20 percent of the women shot and killed and 28 percent of the unarmed deaths.**\

```{r}

#mutating the data to take the amount of values that identify both as black and female and dividing it by the total to see the amount of black women shot fatally by police
total_percentage_black_women <- police_shooting_date %>%
  summarize(total_people = n()) %>%
  mutate(black_count = sum(police_shooting_date$race == "B" & police_shooting_date$gender == "F", na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(total_percentage_black_women = (black_count / total_people) * 100)

total_percentage_black_women

#of the fatal shooting cases, 0.85% were black women, meaning they were less than one percent 
percentage_black_women <- police_shooting_women %>%
  summarize(total_people = n()) %>%
  mutate(women_black_count = sum(police_shooting_women$race == "B", na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(percentage_black_women = (women_black_count / total_people) * 100)

percentage_black_women
#of the women population data, black women accounted for 19.35% of women who were shot fatally by the police


unarmed_black_women_final <- police_shooting_date %>%
  summarize(total_people = n()) %>%
  mutate(unarmed_black_women = sum(police_shooting_date$race == "B" & police_shooting_date$gender == "F" & police_shooting_date$armed == "unarmed", na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
